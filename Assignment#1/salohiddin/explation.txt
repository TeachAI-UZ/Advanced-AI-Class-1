# Assignment 1 explanation

Completed all the subtasks of the Assignment #1

I modelrately changed the all codes, so that I can be able to train, validate and run inference and get plots
(learning curves) after train/validation and confusion matrix after inference.

1.4 Conducted experiments with resnet50, xception, vit_tiny_224, vit_large_224

1.7 Since batch_size =1 takes very long time, I tested resnet50 with bs=32/96/192

1.8 Plotted the curves for the task 1.7.
